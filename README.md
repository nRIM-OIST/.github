- Experimental neuroscience (calcium imaging, electrophysiology)
- Advanced motion capture methodologies (marker-based MoCap)
- Computational modeling and analysis

## Our Repositories
Our organization hosts repositories for:
- Published papers (code and data)
- Lab-developed software and tools
- Open resources and tutorials
